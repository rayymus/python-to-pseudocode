# Python to Pseudocode
## Instructions
Download `converter.py` in the same folder as your code to be converted.
Change line 7 of `converter.py` to be your code file name.
Run `converter.py`, it should create a new `.txt` file, and output "Done" in the console.
Be sure to check `limitations.md` before you post an issue.
